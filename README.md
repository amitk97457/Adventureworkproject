# Azure Data Engineering Project: End-to-End Data Transformation with Medallion Architecture

## Project Overview
- Implemented an end-to-end data pipeline using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, **Azure Databricks**, **Azure Synapse Analytics**, and **Azure Data Lake Gen2**.
- Utilized **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to structure the data pipeline and ensure incremental data processing and high-quality output.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
- **Azure Databricks** (PySpark)
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL Pools)**
- **Microsoft Entra ID**
- **Python**
- **SQL**

## Architecture Overview
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion.
- **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing and transformation.
- **Gold Layer**: Aggregated, transformed data ready for reporting.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
- Ingested data from source using **Azure Data Factory** (ADF).
- Created an **HTTPS linked service** to connect ADF to the source.
- Data was fetched from the **Relative URL** after the linked service was set up.
- Used a **dynamic pipeline** to automate data ingestion into **Azure Data Lake Gen2**.
- Data stored in the **Bronze Layer** for further processing.

### 2. Data Transformation (Silver Layer)
- Data transformation was performed using **Azure Databricks** (PySpark).
- Established a connection between **Azure Data Lake Gen2** and **Databricks** using **Microsoft Entra ID** for authentication (Application ID, Secret Value, and Tenant ID).
- Compared the transformation process to **refining crude oil into petrol**, adding value to the raw data.
- Cleaned, transformed, and enriched the data.

### 3. Data Storage and Final Output (Gold Layer)
- Created **views** and **external tables** in **Azure Synapse Analytics** (Serverless SQL Pools).
- **External Tables** created on top of the **metadata layer** for a unified view of the data.
- Final, transformed data pushed into the **Gold Layer** for business use and reporting.

## Key Takeaways
- **Scalability**: **Dynamic pipelines** in ADF ensure scalability for future data sources.
- **Data Quality**: Data cleansing and transformation ensure high-quality, valuable data.
- **Cost-Effective**: Using **serverless SQL pools** in Synapse Analytics optimizes costs.
- **Medallion Architecture**: Enables structured, incremental data transformation, improving data at each stage.

## Challenges
- **Data Connectivity**: Required configuration of **Microsoft Entra ID** credentials to establish secure connections between **Azure Data Lake Gen2** and **Databricks**.
- **Data Size**: Dealing with large datasets in the Bronze layer required efficient ingestion techniques to avoid performance issues.

## Future Improvements
- **Automation**: Implement data quality checks and validations during transformation.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Add real-time data ingestion and transformation pipelines.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate **Azure Machine Learning** for predictive analytics.

## Conclusion
- Designed and implemented a **scalable, efficient data pipeline** using **Azure cloud technologies**.
- Leveraged the **Medallion Architecture** for high-quality data transformation and reporting.
